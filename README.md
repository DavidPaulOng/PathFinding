A personal project for learning creating a visualization of pathfinding algorithms. It is created using the Unity Game engine and the C# programming language for its scripts.

You are able to dynamically change the start and finish points of the path and create blocks to change the available tiles / traversable tiles

<h2>Algorithms Implemented</h2>

<h3>Greedy Algorithm</h3>
An algorithm that creates decision based on the next locally optimal solution. Often creates inoptimal solutions and is usually used for approximations

<h3>A* Algorithm</h3>
One of the best algorithms for pathfinding. It takes into consideration the distance traveled from the starting position in addition to the base heuristic of the greedy algorithm.
